The Sub-Fund
The Sub-Fund is a feeder fund which, in seeking to achieve its investment objective, invests 90% or more of its total net asset value in the All Market Income Portfolio (“underlying scheme”), a portfolio under AB SICAV I, an open￾ended investment company with variable capital (société d’investissement à capital variable) that is qualified as a UCITS, incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and authorized by the SFC.The Sub-Fund may also invest up to 10% of its net asset value on an ancillary basis in money market instruments, cash and cash equivalents for cash management purposes. The Sub-Fund may use derivatives (such as futures, options and/or forward contracts) for hedging purposes. 
The underlying scheme
In actively managing the underlying scheme, the investment manager of the underlying scheme uses fundamental research and a proprietary quantitative analysis to flexibly adjust investment exposures across various asset classes with the goal of building an optimal risk/return portfolio in all market conditions (top-down and bottom-up approach).Under normal market conditions, the underlying scheme typically invests more than 90% of its net asset value in equity securities and debt securities of any credit quality of government and corporate issuers anywhere in the world, including emerging markets (i.e. any country not defined as “high income” by the World Bank, or as otherwise determined by the investment manager of the underlying scheme which includes the subcategory of frontier markets). The underlying scheme may also seek exposure to other asset classes such as real estate, currencies and interest rates, as well as to eligible indices. The underlying scheme is not limited in its exposure to equity, debt securities or currencies.The investment manager of the underlying scheme will actively allocate between equity securities, debt securities, currencies, cash and cash equivalents in seeking to achieve the underlying scheme’s investment objective. The investment manager of the underlying scheme may obtain exposure to such instruments through direct investment, the use of financial derivative instruments and by investing in other pooled investment vehicles, including in exchange traded funds. The investment manager of the underlying scheme will utilize its proprietary “Dynamic Asset Allocation”strategy to adjust the underlying scheme’s various investment exposures among these asset classes with the goal of producing what the investment manager of the underlying scheme considers to be the underlying scheme’s optimal risk/return profile at any particular point in time. The underlying scheme is not subject to any limitation on the portion of its net asset value that may be invested in equities, debt securities or currencies.
The underlying scheme’s equity investments may include convertible securities, depositary receipts, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and exchange traded funds (ETFs).It is anticipated that under normal market conditions the underlying scheme will not hold below-Investment Grade1 debt securities in excess of 30% of its net asset value, as measured at time of purchase.The underlying scheme will not invest more than 10% of its net asset value in debt securities issued and/or guaranteed by a single sovereign issuer (including its government, public or local authority) which is below Investment Grade1.The underlying scheme may also invest less than 30% of its net asset value in debt instruments with loss-absorption features as defined by the SFC, including, but not limited to, contingent convertible securities, other Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments and senior non-preferred debts. These instruments may be subject to contingent write-down or contingent conversion to ordinary shares on the occurrence of trigger events.The underlying scheme uses derivatives for hedging (reducing risks), efficient portfolio management and other 
investment purposes (including to gain additional exposure).Under exceptional circumstances (e.g. market crash or major crisis), the underlying scheme may be invested temporarily up to 100% in cash or cash equivalents (such as bank deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and treasury bills) and high quality short-term securities for cash flow management. To the extent the underlying scheme invests defensively, it may not be pursuing its objective.
1 Investment Grade securities (as defined in the offering document of the underlying scheme) means debt securities rated at or above BBB- by Standard and Poor’s, Baa3 by Moody’s and/or BBB- by Fitch or the equivalent by one nationally recognized statistical rating organization or, for Chinese bonds, the corresponding rating by a China rating agency. Unrated securities will be considered when the investment manager of the underlying scheme believes the financial condition of the issuer or the protections inherent in the securities themselves limit the risk to a degree comparable to that of rated securities that are consistent with the underlying scheme’s objectives and policies. For the purposes of the underlying scheme, “unrated securities” are defined as securities which do not have a credit rating, regardless of whether their issuers have a credit rating.
